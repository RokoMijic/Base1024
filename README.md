# Base1024
A number system that uses unicode characters to encode 10 bits per character, using 0k as the prefix to differentiate itself from hexadecimals.

Some examples:

The pool of characters is currently 1202 and not finalized - more analysis is required to cut unsuitable characters from the pool, or potentially add new ones. It is not recommended to use this project right now. 

Base4096 is a possible extention of this project, likely with a nonoverlapping set.
